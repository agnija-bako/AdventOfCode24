# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024: Stella & Agnija's Friendly Coding Duel 🎄

Welcome, weary coder, to **Stella's and Agnija's Friendly Advent of Code Competition 2024**! 🌟  

Here, you'll witness two friends, **Stella** (the algorithm whisperer) and **Agnija** (the queen of clever hacks), as they embark on a wild ride through the snowy peaks of festive programming puzzles. Armed with caffeine, holiday cheer, and a reckless disregard for code readability, these two are ready to face the coding chaos of December!

## 🎯 **What’s This Repo About?**

This is our cozy little corner of the internet where we stash our solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/). Think of it like a holiday gift exchange, but instead of socks and scarves, we’re swapping lines of **JavaScript**, **C#**, **Python**, and **Go**.  

Expect messy commits, creative approaches, and (probably) wildly different ways of solving the same problem.

## 🥊 **The (Very Chill) Rules**

1. **🎁 Code Your Way**  
   Each of us solves the puzzles however we like, using whatever programming language we fancy that day. Stella might whip out Python; Agnija might throw down some C#. No rules, just vibes.  
   
2. **🎄 Puzzle-a-Day**  
   A new puzzle drops every day at **midnight EST**. We’ll add our solutions here as we go. (No promises on how fast, though—life happens!)  

3. **🤝 Collaboration Encouraged… Kinda**  
   While we’re technically competing, we’re not above exchanging hints or laughing at each other’s debugging misery.

4. **🌟 It's All for Fun!**  
   The real prize is the holiday spirit and bragging rights. 🏆✨

## 🎅 **How to Join the Fun**  

Feel free to browse, learn, or laugh at our solutions. (Or cry—some of these puzzles get *hard.* 😅) Got ideas or a better way to solve a problem? Drop a comment or open an issue. Let’s make it a community celebration!

## 🧑‍💻 **Languages in Play**  
Here’s a non-exhaustive list of languages we might use:  
- JavaScript 🌐  
- C# ⚙️  
- Python 🐍  
- Go 🐹  
- Or whatever else our sleep-deprived brains think is a good idea at 2 AM.

Stay tuned as we unwrap each day’s challenge like coding elves on a mission. Let the festive debugging begin! 🎅💻✨  

Happy holidays and happy coding,  
**Stella & Agnija** 🌟
